                There was a young girl, whose heart was a frown,<br>
                Because she was crippled for life, and couldn't speak a sound<br>
                And she wished and prayed she would stop living, so she decided to die.<br>
                She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore, and to her legs she smiled<br>

                "You won't hurt me no more."<br>
                But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say<br>
                "Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way"<br>
                And it really didn't have to stop...it just kept on going.<br>
                And so castles made of sand slips into the sea, <br>
                Eventually<br>

                Her fight and fury is fiery<br>
                Oh but she loves<br>
                Like sleep to the freezing<br>
                Sweet and right and merciful<br>
                I'm all but washed<br>
                In the tide of her breathing<br>
